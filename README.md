# Referee 

I came up with this idea in 5 minutes for a class task :) 

... a year later I came back to it just as a fun project to code in my spare time.

## 💡 Idea

>My friend and I always argue about whose turn it is to pay for coffee.  
>She is usually very kind, but at that moment very aggressive 😅  
>Now we can continue being good friends and Referee will "keep score" whose turn it is, so that nobody has any doubts.

## Tech Stack
Initially, I planned to make it a mobile app, but I realized I can achieve the same convenience with a web app using Python and Django. 
What is more, in the process I can learn some interesting things like asynchronous programming and how to do it in Django (WebSockets, DjangoChannels vs FastApi, asynchronous protocols, ASGI).
